## A short biography: ##
I am Viviana, I come from Italy, studied there Tourism. After my degree I moved to Frankfurt, in 2014, and worked there for about one year at the Airport. Then in 2015 I moved to Berlin, where I worked since last year in the Body Worlds Museum. 

I have a three years old son, a cute little boy, named Maxim. We have a lot of fun together, mostly outside exploring ever new Parks and Playgrounds.

My hobbies are playing Ukulele, I started about six months ago and it is a lot of fun; jogging and I love travel. I did never travel outside Europe, so my dream is to start soon with that. 

Another of my hobbies is cooking, I do it almost everyday. I like to experiment new recipes and also to coke with other people. Following one of my favorite.
